Our series is split into two main categories: SASS rules and SASS at-rules, if you recall the course mindmap from the [sass syntax](https://dev.to/ak_ram/sass-syntax-34f1) post. The one SASS rule we didn't cover in the previous posts was **Placeholder Selector**, so now we're going to talk about it.


## Placeholder Selector

A sass placeholder is a special sass selector that begins with a % and it is used to hold CSS styles blocks like this one in the example below:

Although it is comparable to a class selector, it is not converted into CSS code.

How then may this selection be of use?

A placeholder may be seen as a box that contains a block of CSS styles that can be applied in many ways without repeating, thanks to the sass at-rule "@extend."

Finally, we can say that the posts that will come after this one will introduce SCSS at-rules.

See You 😉
